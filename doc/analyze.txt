usage: job analyze [-h] [--out OUT]
                   [-v OUTPUT_VARIABLES [OUTPUT_VARIABLES ...]] [--stats]
                   [-l NAME=DIST [NAME=DIST ...]] [-J COST [COST ...]]
                   expdir

Analyze run results

positional arguments:
  expdir                experiment directory to analyze

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --out OUT             experiment directory to write the diagnostics to (by
                        default same as expdir)

model output:

  -v OUTPUT_VARIABLES [OUTPUT_VARIABLES ...], --output-variables OUTPUT_VARIABLES [OUTPUT_VARIABLES ...]
                        list of output variables to include in output.txt,
                        does not necessarily enter in the likelihood
  --stats               add statistics on model output

likelihood:
  likelihood is provided a list of distributions (same convention as job sample)

  -l NAME=DIST [NAME=DIST ...], --likelihood NAME=DIST [NAME=DIST ...]
                        NAME=SPEC where SPEC define a distribution: N?MEAN,STD
                        or U?MIN,MAX or TYPE?ARG1[,ARG2 ...] where TYPE is any
                        scipy.stats distribution with *shp, loc, scale
                        parameters.
  -J COST [COST ...], --cost COST [COST ...]
                        output variables that shall be treated as the result
                        of an objective (or cost) function, this is equivalent
                        to have the likelihood N?0,1
